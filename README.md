## Executive Summary
The prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety among students is alarmingly high, with rates of 18.5% and 16.7% respectively. This presents a significant challenge to student well-being and academic success. In Indonesia, depression is the leading mental health issue among those aged 15 to 24, impacting 6.2% of students. Recognizing the crucial link between mental well-being and academic achievement, behavior, and satisfaction, we developed Kalmakasa. This mental health consultation app leverages the DASS 21 questionnaire to assess students' levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, providing customized support. Our goal is to improve the mental well-being of Indonesian undergraduate students, thereby enhancing their overall success and satisfaction.

## What We Do
Kalmakasa integrates advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to offer a two-fold solution:

- Multi-Class Classification: Utilizing ML algorithms to categorize mental health states into various conditions based on user's journal.

- Chatbot: An interactive chatbot to guide users through the questionnaire and provide initial feedback and recommendations.

## Languages and Tools
This project is developed using a range of powerful technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The core programming language for our development.

- **TensorFlow**: An open-source platform for machine learning.

- **Scikit-Learn**: A tool for data mining and data analysis.

- **NumPy**: Essential for scientific computing with Python.

- **Pandas**: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures.

- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for Python and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
